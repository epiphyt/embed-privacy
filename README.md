# Embed Privacy

Embed Privacy prevents the loading of embedded external content and allows your site visitors to opt-in.

Content embedded from external sites such as YouTube or Twitter is loaded immediately when visitors access your site. Embed Privacy addresses this issue and prevents the loading of these contents until the visitor decides to allow loading of external content.
But Embed Privacy not only protects your visitor's privacy but also makes your site load faster.

All embeds will be replaced by placeholders, ready for you to apply style as you wish. With only a couple of lines of CSS. 

By clicking on the placeholder the respective content will then be loaded.
